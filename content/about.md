# Hi there

My name is Alex. I'm a college student with aspirations and interests in Data Analytics, Economics, and am generally interested in how we visualize and make decisions with data.

I have enough experience to feel very comfortable writing code in R, and am working towards that point in Tableau through an on campus student job. I've found that I really enjoy working in R, and am using this blog as an opportunity to exercise that skillset. I've also got some experience with coding languages like Java, C, and Python. And while it doesn't count as the "big data" we all love to get worked up about as data scientists, I do know my way around an Excel file.

This blog is a documentation of my learning and knowledge in many things, including R and Analytics, but also anything I find myself interested in enough to write about. 

My interests include:

- **Analytics**, Data Analytics is one of my majors here at college
- **Economics**, Economics is my other major, it is something I've found I enjoy greatly.
- **Sports**, I have the unfortunate character trait of being a Philadelphia sports fan. It's a blessing and a curse, really.
