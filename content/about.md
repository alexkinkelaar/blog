title: About Me
---

I'm a college student with interests in Data Analytics, Economics, and much more. I'm an experienced R, Tableau, and Excel user, and am working on developing skills in many other tools, like Python and C. I hope to use this site to share my experiences and knowledge, and as a place to talk about what interests me. 

This site is largely written using Hugo and R studio, which is great, because it allows me to develop my familiarity with programs like Git, and gain some experience with a more complicated workflow. 

Thanks for reading!
